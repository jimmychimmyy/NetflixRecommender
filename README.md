# Netflix Recommender

### Getting Started
1. Start by downloading the [Netflix dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data#) and placing it inside the NetflixRecommender root directory.

2. Next, run this on your command line: `python rewrite_netflix_csv.py` This will rewrite the dataset to improve performance.

3. Run this command to test the recommender: `python netflix.py`


### TODO
* add interactive option for user to select which movie to provide rating for
* use pyspark to improve performance (https://www.davidadrian.cc/posts/2017/08/how-to-spark-cluster/)
